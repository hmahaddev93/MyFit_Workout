// Strip Debug Symbols During Copy
// 
// Activating this setting causes binary files which are copied during the build (e.g.,
// in a Copy Bundle Resources or Copy Files build phase) to be stripped of debugging
// symbols.  It does not cause the linked product of a target to be stripped (use Strip
// Linked Product for that).

// Validate Built Product
//
